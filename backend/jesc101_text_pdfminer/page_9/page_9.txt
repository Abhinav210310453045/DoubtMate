Let  us  perform  some  more  decomposition  reactions  as  given  in
Activities 1.7 and 1.8.

n Take  a  plastic  mug.  Drill  two  holes  at  its
base and fit rubber stoppers in these holes.
Insert  carbon  electrodes  in  these  rubber
stoppers as shown in Fig. 1.6.
n Connect  these  electrodes  to  a  6  volt
battery.
n Fill  the  mug  with  water  such  that  the
electrodes  are  immersed.  Add  a  few  drops
of  dilute  sulphuric  acid  to  the  water.
n Take  two  test  tubes  filled  with  water  and
invert them over the two carbon electrodes.
n Switch  on  the  current  and  leave  the
apparatus  undisturbed  for  some  time.
n You will observe the formation of bubbles
at  both  the  electrodes.  These  bubbles  displace  water  in  the
test  tubes.
n Is the volume of the gas collected the same in both the test tubes?
n Once  the  test  tubes  are  filled  with  the  respective  gases,  remove
them  carefully.
n Test  these  gases  one  by  one  by  bringing  a  burning  candle  close
to the mouth of the test tubes.
CAUTION: This step must be performed carefully by the teacher.
n What  happens  in  each  case?
n Which  gas  is  present  in  each  test  tube?

n Take  about  2  g  silver  chloride  in  a  china  dish.
n What  is  its  colour?
n Place  this  china  dish  in  sunlight  for  some  time
(Fig. 1.7).
n Observe the colour of the silver chloride after some
time.
Figure 1.6
Electrolysis of water
You will see that white silver chloride turns grey in sunlight. This is
due to the decomposition of silver chloride into silver and chlorine by
light.
