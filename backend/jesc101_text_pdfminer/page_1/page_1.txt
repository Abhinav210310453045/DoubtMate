CHAPTER
Chemical Reactions
and Equations
Consider the following situations of daily life and think what happens
when –
n milk  is  left  at  room  temperature  during  summers.
n an  iron  tawa/pan/nail  is  left  exposed  to  humid  atmosphere.
n grapes  get  fermented.
n food is cooked.
n food gets digested in our body.
n we  respire.
In  all  the  above  situations,  the  nature  and  the  identity  of  the  initial
substance have somewhat changed. We have already learnt about physical
and chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical
change occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place.
You may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a
chemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction
has taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to
these questions.

CAUTION: This Activity needs
the  teacher’s  assistance.  It
would  be  better  if  students
wear  suitable  eyeglasses.
n Clean  a  magnesium  ribbon
about 3-4 cm long by rubbing
it  with  sandpaper.
n Hold  it  with  a  pair  of  tongs.
Burn it using a spirit lamp or
burner and collect the ash so
formed  in  a  watch-glass  as
shown  in  Fig.  1.1.  Burn    the
magnesium ribbon keeping it
away  as  far  as  possible  from
your  eyes.
n What  do  you  observe?
