(i) Solutions of barium chloride and sodium sulphate in water react
to  give  insoluble  barium  sulphate  and  the  solution  of  sodium
chloride.
(ii) Sodium  hydroxide  solution  (in  water)  reacts  with  hydrochloric

We have learnt in Class IX that during a chemical reaction atoms of one
element do not change into those of another element. Nor do atoms
disappear from the mixture or appear from elsewhere. Actually, chemical
reactions involve the breaking and making of bonds between atoms to
produce new substances. You will study about types of bonds formed
between atoms in Chapters 3 and 4.

Formation  of  slaked
lime by the reaction of
calcium  oxide  with
water
Calcium oxide reacts vigorously with water to produce slaked lime
(calcium hydroxide) releasing a large amount of heat.

In this reaction, calcium oxide and water combine to form a single
product, calcium hydroxide. Such a reaction in which a single product
is formed from two or more reactants is known as a combination reaction.
