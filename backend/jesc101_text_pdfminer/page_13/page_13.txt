In reaction (1.31) carbon is oxidised to CO and ZnO is reduced to Zn.
In reaction (1.32) HCl is oxidised to Cl2 whereas MnO2 is reduced to MnCl2.
From the above examples we can say that if a substance gains oxygen
or loses hydrogen during a reaction, it is oxidised. If a substance loses
oxygen or gains hydrogen during a reaction, it is reduced.

and changes into a white substance, magnesium oxide. Is magnesium being oxidised or
reduced in this reaction?

1.3.1 Corrosion
You must have observed that iron articles are shiny when new, but get
coated with a reddish brown powder when left for some time. This process
is  commonly  known  as  rusting  of  iron.  Some  other  metals  also  get
tarnished in this manner. Have you noticed the colour of the coating
formed on copper and silver? When a metal is attacked by substances
around it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this
process is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green
coating on copper are other examples of corrosion.
Corrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships
and to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of
iron is a serious problem. Every year an enormous amount of money is
spent to replace damaged iron. You will learn more about corrosion in
Chapter 3.
1.3.2  Rancidity
Have you ever tasted or smelt the fat/oil containing food materials left
for a long time?
When fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell
and  taste  change.  Usually  substances  which  prevent  oxidation
(antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food
in air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation. Do you know that
chips  manufacturers  usually  flush  bags  of  chips  with  gas  such  as
nitrogen to prevent the chips from getting oxidised ?

Why  does  the  colour  of  copper  sulphate  solution  change  when
an iron nail is dipped in it?
Give  an  example  of  a  double  displacement  reaction  other  than
the  one  given  in  Activity  1.10.
Identify  the  substances  that  are  oxidised  and  the  substances
that  are  reduced  in  the  following  reactions.
(i) 4Na(s) + O2(g) → 2Na2O(s)
(ii) CuO(s) + H2(g) → Cu(s) + H2O(l)
