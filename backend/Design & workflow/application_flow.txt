1>Database that contains PDFs for particular subject
2>We extract text from the pdfs using pdfminer(for now) and store in the following manner
|-{pdf_name}+{extraction_tool_name}
    |- Page_{number} 
        |-Page_{number}.txt
        |-Processed_Page_{number}.txt


3>Created a Class that gives these page wise text as input to the LLM and 
  LLM is prompted to clean the text a bit but do not alter the text at all as We want to store the Raw text.
  in Processed_Page_{number}.txt

4>Then we have to create a wrapper module that uses these to classes and createst these processed txt files.
  This module should be a class  that has the methods to process these texts because.
  1.we will be having large number of pdfs to process.
  2.The object of this module will be responsible:
    1. taking the pdfs as input.
    2. utilize the clean_data_agent and text_extractor agent to preprocess the pdfs text and store in the Database
5> We have to following Databases.
   1> Database with seprecate containers:
      1.for pdfs
      2.for Txt files for each pdfs
      3>for Conversations and Queries.
   2> Vector Database for storing the Enbedding of processed txt data with proper index and meta information

6> We have to create the proper Chat Interface using Langraph so that user can utilize the RAG powered app seamlessly with conversation hisroty management across the Chat.
