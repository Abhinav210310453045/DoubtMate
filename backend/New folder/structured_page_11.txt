Figure 1.8 (b) Iron nails and copper sulphate solutions compared before and after the experiment

<questions>
Why does the iron nail become brownish in colour and the blue colour
of copper sulphate solution fades?
</questions>
The following chemical reaction takes place in this Activity–
Fe(s) + CuSO4(aq) → FeSO4(aq)    +   Cu(s)
        (Copper sulphate)      (Iron sulphate)
                                                                (1.24)
In this reaction, iron has displaced or removed another element,
copper,  from  copper  sulphate  solution.  This  reaction  is  known  as
displacement reaction.
Other examples of displacement reactions are
Zn(s) + CuSO4(aq)   → ZnSO4(aq)   +     Cu(s)
     (Copper sulphate)           (Zinc  sulphate)
                                                                (1.25)
Pb(s) + CuCl2(aq)   → PbCl2(aq)     +     Cu(s)
      (Copper chloride)              (Lead chloride)
                                                                (1.26)
Zinc and lead are more reactive elements than copper. They displace
copper from its compounds.

1.2.4 Double Displacement Reaction

<activity>
Activity  1.10
n Take  about  3  mL  of  sodium  sulphate
solution  in  a  test  tube.
n In another test tube, take about 3 mL of
barium  chloride  solution.
n Mix the two solutions (Fig. 1.9).
n What  do  you  observe?
You will observe that a white substance, which is
insoluble in water, is formed. This insoluble substance
formed is known as a precipitate. Any reaction that
produces a precipitate can be called a precipitation reaction.
Na2SO4(aq) + BaCl2(aq) → BaSO4(s) + 2NaCl(aq)
 (Sodium               (Barium               (Barium               (Sodium
  sulphate)              chloride)              sulphate)              chloride)
                                                                (1.27)
