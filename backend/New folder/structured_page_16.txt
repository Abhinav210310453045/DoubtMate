Group Activity
Perform the following activity.

- Take four beakers and label them as A, B, C and D.
- Put 25 mL of water in A, B and C beakers and copper sulphate solution in beaker D.
- Measure and record the temperature of each liquid contained in the beakers above.
- Add two spatulas of potassium sulphate, ammonium nitrate, anhydrous copper sulphate and fine iron filings to beakers A, B, C and D respectively and stir.
- Finally measure and record the temperature of each of the mixture above.
- Find out which reactions are exothermic and which ones are endothermic in nature.
