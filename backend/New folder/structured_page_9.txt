Let us perform some more decomposition reactions as given in
Activities 1.7 and 1.8.

<activity>
Activity 1.7
• Take a plastic mug. Drill two holes at its
  base and fit rubber stoppers in these holes.
  Insert carbon electrodes in these rubber
  stoppers as shown in Fig. 1.6.
• Connect these electrodes to a 6 volt
  battery.
• Fill the mug with water such that the
  electrodes are immersed. Add a few drops
  of dilute sulphuric acid to the water.
• Take two test tubes filled with water and
  invert them over the two carbon electrodes.
• Switch on the current and leave the
  apparatus undisturbed for some time.
• You will observe the formation of bubbles
  at both the electrodes. These bubbles displace water in the
  test tubes.
• Is the volume of the gas collected the same in both the test tubes?
• Once the test tubes are filled with the respective gases, remove
  them carefully.
• Test these gases one by one by bringing a burning candle close
  to the mouth of the test tubes.
CAUTION: This step must be performed carefully by the teacher.
• What happens in each case?
• Which gas is present in each test tube?

Activity 1.8
• Take about 2 g silver chloride in a china dish.
• What is its colour?
• Place this china dish in sunlight for some time
  (Fig. 1.7).
• Observe the colour of the silver chloride after some
  time.
</activity>

You will see that white silver chloride turns grey in sunlight. This is
due to the decomposition of silver chloride into silver and chlorine by
light.
