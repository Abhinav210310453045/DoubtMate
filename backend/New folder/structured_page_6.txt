1.2 TYPES OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS

We have learnt in Class IX that during a chemical reaction atoms of one
element do not change into those of another element. Nor do atoms
disappear from the mixture or appear from elsewhere. Actually, chemical
reactions involve the breaking and making of bonds between atoms to
produce new substances. You will study about types of bonds formed
between atoms in Chapters 3 and 4.

1.2.1 Combination Reaction

<activity>
Activity 1.4
n Take a small amount of calcium oxide
or quick lime in a beaker.
n Slowly add water to this.
n Touch the beaker as shown in Fig. 1.3.
n Do you feel any change in temperature?

Figure 1.3
Formation of slaked
lime by the reaction of
calcium oxide with
water

Calcium oxide reacts vigorously with water to produce slaked lime
(calcium hydroxide) releasing a large amount of heat.
CaO(s) (Quick lime) + H2O(l) → Ca(OH)2(aq) (Slaked lime) + Heat (1.13)

In this reaction, calcium oxide and water combine to form a single
product, calcium hydroxide. Such a reaction in which a single product
is formed from two or more reactants is known as a combination reaction.
