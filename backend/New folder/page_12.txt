What causes this? The  white precipitate of BaSO4 is formed by the
4SO  and Ba2+. The other product formed is sodium chloride
reaction of 
which remains in the solution. Such reactions in which there is an
exchange of ions between the reactants are called double displacement
reactions.

(i) What  was  the  colour  of  the  precipitate  formed?  Can  you  name  the  compound
precipitated?

n Heat a china dish containing about 1 g
copper powder (Fig. 1.10).
n What  do  you  observe?
The surface of copper powder becomes coated with
black  copper(II)  oxide.  Why  has  this  black
substance formed?
This is because oxygen is added to copper and
copper oxide is formed.

If hydrogen gas is passed over this heated material (CuO), the black
coating on the surface turns brown as the reverse reaction takes place
and copper is obtained.

If a substance gains oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be oxidised.
If a substance loses oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be reduced.
During this reaction (1.29), the copper(II) oxide is losing oxygen and
is being reduced. The hydrogen is gaining oxygen and is being oxidised.
In other words, one reactant gets oxidised while the other gets reduced
during a reaction. Such reactions are called oxidation-reduction reactions
or redox reactions.
